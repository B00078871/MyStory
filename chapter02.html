<h1>Chapter 2 of My Story</h1>
<p>
So here I am in my final year of study in ITB, almost completed my level 7 degree in computing. However, I do have plans to continue on with my study, completing a minimum of a level 8 honours degree. I haven't yet decided whether to do it here in ITB or else where like DIT. I've got myself a job lined up for the summer so I should be okay financially for the next year. I've purchased a newer, much more reliable car after borrowing money from my parents, whom I'll repay at the end of summer.
