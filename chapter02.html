<h1>Chapter 2 of My Story</h1>
<p>
So here I am in my final year of study in ITB, almost completed my level 7 degree in computing. However, I do have plans to continue on with my study, completing a minimum of a level 8 honours degree. I haven't yet decided whether to do it here in ITB or else where like DIT. I've got myself a job lined up for the summer so I should be okay financially for the next year. I've purchased a newer, much more reliable car after borrowing money from my parents, whom I'll repay at the end of summer.
All of this of course depends on my final exam results for semester 2 in year 3. I was fortunate enough to have passed all of my modules in semester 1 so at least now I can be solely focused on achieving the same for semester 2. I don't have much summer exams but there is a lot of continue assessment assignments and proects which are proving difficult to deal with so far. I'll try my best with all of them and hopefully I'll be successful come my results in June. If I don't pass all of them first round, then in August I'll just have to repeat and hopefully get the result I need then. So far I haven't ever had to repeat an exam in August so I do hope I can maintain this record. :)
