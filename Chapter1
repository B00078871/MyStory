<h1>My college life</h1>
<p>
I was 17 years old starting college, too young to join in on all the "freshers" social events and yet too old to be 
spoon fed by teachers. Everything was new; the area, the transport, the lecturers, the students and the soon-to-be college mates.
I turned 18 years old, two months into the first semester. At last, I could go out to all these "wild social events", 
which to my surprise, proved to be more difficult than I initially anticipated. Between weekly college assignments, group projects 
and upcoming Christmas exams, it was a lot harder to find the time to go out and enjoy time being a student.
Growing up through my teenage years, all i ever wanted was yo drive my car. It was a dream to one day get to drive to college 
everyday and not have to spend the best part of four hours a day travelling on muptiple buses and trains. This wa something I was
adament to achieve. So now, despite being a young college student at the age of 18, I resisted as much as I could from going out, 
spending a small fortune on drinks and partying every weekend so I could save up for this car. I saved and saved and saved. It wasn't 
easy but looking back now, it all paid off, here I am driving to college everyday with my friends, living the dream I once I had.
