<h1>My college life</h1>
<p>
I was 17 years old starting college, too young to join in on all the "freshers" social events and yet too old to be 
spoon fed by teachers. Everything was new; the area, the transport, the lecturers, the students and the soon-to-be college mates.
I turned 18 years old, two months into the first semester. At last, I could go out to all these "wild social events", 
which to my surprise, proved to be more difficult than I initially anticipated. Between weekly college assignments, group projects 
and upcoming Christmas exams, it was a lot harder to find the time to go out and enjoy time being a student.
Growing up through my teenage years, all I ever wanted was yo drive my car. It was a dream to one day get to drive to college 
everyday and not have to spend the best part of four hours a day travelling on muptiple buses and trains. This was something I was
adament to achieve. So now, despite being a young college student at the age of 18, I resisted as much as I could from going out, 
spending a small fortune on drinks and partying every weekend so I could save up for this car. I saved for many months, passed my theory 
exam, completed all the necessary lessons (12 hours total) and passed the full driving test full time in order to be able to afford the 
crazy car insurance cost. All this wasn't easy but looking back now, it all paid off, here I am driving to college everyday with my 
friends, living the dream I once I had.
Life was sweet, until the car started giving serious trouble. Every month hundreds of euro has gone into repairing it from the electics to
 fuel injectors, there was something going wrong every few weeks, on top of all the regular servicing and tyres of course. After spending
 a fortune on it, I'm finally in a position to borrow money for a newer, more modern one that will not fail on me. It will be once again nice to know
 everytime I set foot in it, it will successfully bring me, trouble free, to my destination.
