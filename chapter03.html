<h1>Chapter3: After College Life</h1>
<p>
	<b>"Where to go once I finish college..."</b> something all of us wonder but are never guaranteed of knowing. We all have a vague plan of some sort but life can always throw up unexpecting obstacles. For me, my general career plan after my degree consists of getting a well paid IT job of some sort and buy my first brand new car. Then saving for a house, some would say my priorities are backward but it's all I've ever wanted... a VW Golf GTI.
	My dream job, for later in life, would be some sort IT management role in a large multinational organisation such as Facebook or Google. However, starting out I would be happy enough with a regular IT Helpdesk role as I've already got previous experience in that area.

<h2>Alternative Ending to My Story</h2>
<p>
	If that rough plan doesn't work out, I would like to perhaps work and live abroad for a short number of years. Probably in Europe somewhere although I wouldn't mind the States or Australia, hard to find IT jobs there though. I like to keep my options open. I would also like to be able to travel abroad and see different sights, experiencing a whole different lifestyle. Problem with this, is waiting until my girlfriend finishes college and gets her degree.
