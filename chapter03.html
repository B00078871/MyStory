<h1>Chapter3: After College Life</h1>
<p>
	<b>"Where to go once I finish college..."</b> something all of us wonder but are never guaranteed of knowing. We all have a vague plan of some sort but life can always throw up unexpecting obstacles. For me, my general career plan for after college consists of getting a well paid IT job of some sort and buy my first brand new car, Golf GTI to be specific.
	My dream job would be some sort IT management role in a large multinationalorganisation such as Facebook or Google. However, starting out I would be happy enough with a regular IT Helpdesk role as I've alreaady got previous experience in that area.
